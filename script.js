/* Area of Quadrilaterals.
 *
 * Opening, once:
 *   0. Swiftee jumps up into the middle of the landscape, greets the learner
 *      from a speech bubble ("Hey there", then "Let's do a quick warm-up!"),
 *      and jumps away off the bottom of the screen; the board fades in, and
 *      Swiftee jumps up from behind it to its place beside the heading
 *   0b. each shape draws its own outline, then the colour pours in, and the
 *      heading types "Here are a few common shapes."
 *
 * Then every round runs the same beats:
 *   1. that round's slots fade up
 *   2. that round's chips fade up
 *   3. the prompt types itself out in step with the voice-over -- Swiftee
 *      talking along with it -- while a half-transparent chip demonstrates
 *      the drag; the screen is dead to input the whole time
 *   4. the voice-over ends, the prompt stays put, play begins; every drop is
 *      answered in the heading ("That's Correct" / "Try again")
 *   5. all three docked -> "Well Done!", confetti from the sky, then the next
 *      round
 *
 * Round 2 also coaches: one wrong drop labels the sides of every shape, a
 * second wrong drop concedes and flies the formulas into place itself.
 *
 *   Round 1  name the shape     Rectangle / Square / Triangle
 *   Round 2  area of the shape  Length x Breadth / (Side)^2 / 1/2 x Base x Height
 *
 * Section 2, the triangle lesson, once a Next button in the footer is pressed:
 *   1. Swiftee jumps back behind the board and the warm-up fades off it
 *   2. one triangle draws itself in the middle of the empty board
 *   3. Swiftee jumps back up: "A triangle can be of different types."
 *   4. the triangle slides left; a right-angled and an obtuse one join it
 *   5. "Let's observe their base and height." -- dotted base and height lines
 *      grow onto all three
 *   6. the area formula types itself out under them; as "Base" and then
 *      "Height" land, the matching lines on every triangle light up
 *   7. Next
 *
 * Section 3, the quadrilateral, once that Next is pressed:
 *   1. Swiftee jumps back behind the board and the lesson fades off it
 *   2. one quadrilateral draws itself in the middle of the empty board and
 *      glides to the left half of it
 *   3. three names fade up on the right half, one to tap; then Swiftee
 *      comes up from behind the board above them and asks "What shape is
 *      this?" from its box (user, 2026-09-25: the options first, then the
 *      question). Each choice is answered in the same box, with how many
 *      sides that shape has
 *   4. the quiz goes, the shape comes back to the middle, and Swiftee is up
 *      again beside it: "This is a general quadrilateral." / "Let's try and
 *      find its area!"
 *   5. Swiftee goes back behind the board -- removed after "Let's try and
 *      find its area!", not before it (user, 2026-09-25); two dots appear
 *      on the corners, and Swiftee comes up at the heading with "Join the
 *      corners to draw a diagonal.", which types while a finger traces the
 *      diagonal, left to right
 *   6. the learner draws it: the halves shade in two colours -- "Now, the
 *      quadrilateral is divided into two triangles. Let's look at each
 *      triangle." -- and the shape slides left
 *   7. one triangle at a time, in conversation (review, 2026-09-25): the
 *      half comes forward and the other steps back; "Let's say the base of
 *      this triangle is b." lights the diagonal and names it; "And its
 *      height is h₁." drops the height and names it; "So, its area will be
 *      …" writes the line beside the shape, "½ ×" typed and then the b and
 *      the h₁ floated off the drawing's own labels into their places.
 *      Next; then the same for the other triangle; Next
 *   8. the two together: the third line is the sum of the two, worked where
 *      it stands to ½ × b × (h₁ + h₂); then a copy of it peels off onto the
 *      row below and is put into words -- b becomes "Diagonal", the bracket
 *      "Sum of perpendicular heights" -- and "So this is the area of the
 *      quadrilateral!"; Next
 *   9. the same shape again, cut top to bottom: the learner draws that
 *      diagonal, the halves shade and their base and heights are named,
 *      and then -- no triangle lines this time (review, 2026-09-25) -- the
 *      rule in words is typed out, a copy of it peels off onto the row
 *      below, and in the copy "(Diagonal)" and then "(Sum of perpendicular
 *      heights)" each dissolve into a drop-down; the learner fills them in
 *      symbols -- the diagonal from b / h₁ / h₂, the sum of the heights
 *      from h₁ + h₂ / b + h₁ / b + h₂; then the celebration and Next
 *
 * Section 4: a different quadrilateral, with measurements. Its diagonal and
 * heights draw themselves; the learner picks each triangle's base and height
 * from the measurements, and the working (½ × 10 × 6 = 30 sq. cm ...) types
 * itself out, then the two are added.
 *
 * Section 5: the learner's own go. A third quadrilateral, already cut and
 * measured: the sum of the heights and the diagonal from drop-downs, then the
 * area itself.
 *
 * Between: the board goes, and Swiftee says from its speech bubble that the
 * special quadrilaterals are next.
 *
 * Section 6, the parallelogram (the first special quadrilateral):
 *   1. the board comes back and a parallelogram draws itself on it
 *   2. Swiftee jumps up to the heading: "What shape is this?" over two
 *      chips, Parallelogram and Trapezium; the wrong one steps back
 *   3. the top and bottom sides light up and are carried on past their
 *      corners -- they never meet -- and take arrow marks; the left and
 *      right do the same; Swiftee hops down beside the fact list:
 *      "Opposite sides are parallel to each other."
 *   4. a glowing copy of the top side travels down to lie exactly over the
 *      bottom, tick marks land on both; the left side onto the right;
 *      "Opposite sides are equal in length."
 *   5. Next -- the marks clear; the base is drawn under the shape and the
 *      height dropped onto it; the diagonal cuts it into two triangles and
 *      the shape moves aside for the working: ½ × b × h twice is b × h
 *   6. Next -- the shape is put back together: "Which of these is the area
 *      of the parallelogram?" over three formula chips
 *   7. Next -- the learner's own go: the labels become 8 cm and 5 cm, and
 *      the base, the height and then the area are picked from drop-downs
 *   8. Next -- the board goes and Swiftee says from its bubble that a
 *      special parallelogram is next
 *
 * Section 7, the rhombus (the special parallelogram):
 *   1. the board comes back and a second parallelogram, in a colour of its
 *      own, draws itself on it
 *   2. its two diagonals draw corner to corner; the obtuse angle at their
 *      crossing takes an arc, then the other three do, and each is labelled
 *      with its size
 *   3. Swiftee jumps up to the heading: "Drag the points to make each angle
 *      90 degrees." The top and right sides light up with a point on each;
 *      one slides the top side up and down its slant, the other the right
 *      side left and right, and the shape, its diagonals and the four angles
 *      follow every frame. The moment the sides come out equal the four arcs
 *      morph together into little squares and go green
 *   4. the showcase: a glow runs right round the shape and leaves a tick on
 *      each side ("All four sides are equal in length!"), the squares swell
 *      ("And the diagonals meet at a right angle (90°)."), and the heading
 *      names it: a parallelogram with these properties is called a rhombus
 *   5. Swiftee hops down beside the shape: "This is the special
 *      parallelogram called Rhombus." -- and Next
 *   6. Next -- the same rhombus tilts until its long diagonal lies flat; d1
 *      and d2 draw along the diagonals with a right angle marked between
 *      them, and Swiftee jumps up to the heading: "Here, is a Rhombus."
 *   7. d2 leaves; the lower half shades green and its height drops from the
 *      crossing: which of two formulas is its area? Then the upper half in
 *      purple, with its own height, and the same question. Next
 *   8. the shape moves left and the working types out beside it: a line for
 *      each triangle, and a third for the rhombus as the two together. That
 *      third line is then taken the rest of the way where it stands, a step
 *      at a time, only the words that change crossing over: the triangles'
 *      names become 1/2 x d1 x h1 + 1/2 x d1 x h2, that becomes
 *      1/2 x d1 x (h1 + h2), and then -- a ring holding the two heights
 *      together while they give way to the short diagonal drawn solid --
 *      1/2 x d1 x d2, which is boxed. Next
 *   9. the numbers: the shape comes back to the middle, plain, with both
 *      diagonals; "Drag the two lengths into the formula." -- the
 *      diagonals are measured (16 cm and 12 cm) and four lengths appear
 *      under "Area = ½ × [ ] × [ ]"; the two right ones dock, the answer is
 *      said, and Next
 *  10. practice, a Next between each: "Choose the correct area." of the
 *      same rhombus; a rhombus of 240 sq. cm with one diagonal 30 cm --
 *      "Find the other diagonal."; one rhombus 24 cm by 15 cm, which draws
 *      itself on an empty board and takes its diagonals and its lengths
 *      before the board halves and Swiftee asks "What is the area of the
 *      rhombus?" from a panel beside it -- four answers under the formula,
 *      and the right one lights both diagonals and solves the working out;
 *      and a slanted shape with a base and a height -- "Which formula can
 *      you use here?"
 *  11. Next -- the board goes and Swiftee says from its bubble that the
 *      area of a rhombus is known, and another special quadrilateral is next
 *
 * Section 8, the trapezium, in two levels:
 *   1. the board comes back and a trapezium draws itself on it; "This is a
 *      [ v ]" with a drop-down (Kite / Parallelogram / Trapezium) appears
 *      under it, and Swiftee jumps in beside the sentence: "Tap here!" Each
 *      choice is answered in a banner under the sentence, and the shape
 *      takes its "parallel" marks so the answer can be checked against it
 *   2. Next -- the sentence goes and Swiftee ducks behind the board; the
 *      shape fades and six cards take its place, three of them trapeziums.
 *      Swiftee jumps up to the heading -- "Select all the trapeziums." --
 *      and ducks back, taking the line with it. Each tap is answered at
 *      once: a trapezium locks green with confetti, anything else shakes
 *      red and steps back for good
 *   3. Next -- the three other cards leave, the trapeziums line up in one
 *      row and each takes a slot under it; the three names appear below,
 *      and Swiftee jumps up: "Drag each block to the matching shape." --
 *      the warm-up's line and voice-over. Each name is dragged onto its
 *      shape, and Next
 *
 * Section 9, the area of a trapezium -- one unbroken piece, Swiftee
 * narrating every beat, played three times: for the right-angled trapezium
 * (two copies make a rectangle), then the scalene and the isosceles (two
 * copies make a parallelogram):
 *   1. the cards (or the last trapezium) go and a trapezium draws itself in
 *      the middle of the board; it slides to the left and its sides are
 *      named: a on top, b below, h up the left
 *   2. a copy of it lifts off and turns half a circle about the middle of
 *      its slanted side -- a finger pushes it round a curved arrow -- and
 *      lands beside it: the two make the whole. The copy's sides are
 *      named, the equal sides are shown equal (b and b, then a and a), and
 *      the two names along each side of the rectangle merge into a + b
 *   3. Swiftee hops down beside the working: (a + b) x h is the whole;
 *      the copy fades to a dashed outline and the trapezium is half of it,
 *      half of (a + b) x h; the copy goes, the trapezium comes back to the
 *      middle, and the rule is boxed. Confetti, Next
 *   4. practice, a Next between each: a measured trapezium draws itself
 *      and its a, b and h are found from drop-downs and dropped into
 *      A = 1/2 (a + b) x h, then the working step by step; a
 *      second trapezium's sum of parallel sides and height from drop-downs,
 *      then its area from chips; and two trapeziums to compare -- "Tap the
 *      trapezium which has the largest area." -- the working under each

   * (P04-06-lets-try-and-find-its-area.mp3).
   *
   * The clips are keyed by THE LINE ITSELF rather than by the call site, and
   * that is the whole of the wiring:
   *   - a line said on six pages -- "That's Correct!" -- finds its clip
   *     wherever it is typed, without six bindings,
   *   - a line built at run time -- "Try again! Join the left and right
   *     corners.", "...fit together to make a parallelogram!" -- finds its
   *     own the same way, because the built string is what is looked up,
   *   - and a scene never names a file. It types its line exactly as it
   *     always did; the voice comes with it.
   * Every box that shows a line goes through one of the typewriters below,
   * and each of those asks here first. A line with no clip types at its own
   * pace, silently, as it did before there was a recording.

   * when its sides are all equal, so the moment a and b come within a whisker
   * of each other they lock together and the arcs morph into squares, all
   * four at once, and go green; drag away and they unlock and morph back.

   * beside the working. It is played three times, once for each kind of
   * trapezium the learner has just named: right-angled (two copies make a
   * rectangle), then scalene and isosceles (two copies make a
   * parallelogram). The choreography is one piece of code; the kind only
   * changes the corners and the words. Each kind has two entry points, so
   * Replay and the jump menu can land on the rectangle as well as on the
   * start.
   *
   *   1. the last drawing goes (or, the first time, the cards) and a
   *      trapezium draws itself in the MIDDLE of the board; the
   *      right-angled one has its two right angles marked: "Let us try to
   *      find the area of this ... trapezium."
   *   2. its sides are named there, on arrows: a along the top, b along the
   *      bottom, h up the left -- with the height itself dotted in when the
   *      left side is slanted
   *   3. the board opens out to the right and the trapezium slides across
   *      into the left half of it, leaving a whole half free beside it
   *   4. a copy pops out of the trapezium -- in the trapezium's own colours,
   *      so one shape is seen to become two -- takes a colour of its own,
   *      slides across into the free half and flips upside down there: two
   *      shapes now, half the stage each
   *   5. the trapezium's names are carried across to the copy one at a time,
   *      each starting on the side it was measured from and landing on the
   *      side of the copy that is the same, the two glowing green together:
   *      a, then b, then h
   *   6. the copy closes on the trapezium's right side -- the two make one
   *      rectangle or parallelogram -- and the two names along the top merge
   *      into one, a + b, and so do the two along the bottom
   *   7. the drawing moves to the left half of the board and Swiftee hops
   *      down to the right half, beside the working: Total area = length ×
   *      breadth (or base × height) = (a + b) × h, lighting what it names
   *   8. the copy fades to a dashed outline -- the trapezium is exactly
   *      half: Area of Trapezium = Half of total area = ½ × (a + b) × h
   *   9. the copy goes, the trapezium comes back to the middle with a, b
   *      and h and its parallel marks, and the rule is boxed: Area of
   *      Trapezium = ½ × (sum of parallel sides) × height. Confetti, Next. */

   * for them, so the numbers mean something by the time they are used.
   *
   *   1. the board opens empty and the trapezium draws itself on it, slowly
   *      and with no instruction anywhere: there is nothing to read but the
   *      shape. Swiftee waits behind the board
   *   2. the height drops in dotted and squares off at its foot; one chevron
   *      marks each parallel side; then the three measurements arrive one at
   *      a time -- 8 cm, 14 cm, 6 cm -- each on its arrow, each lighting the
   *      line it belongs to for a moment as it lands
   *   3. only now does Swiftee come up beside the heading: "Let's find the
   *      area of this trapezium." The board halves -- the shape glides into
   *      the left half, the panel takes the right -- and three and a half
   *      seconds later the bird ducks back behind the board and takes the
   *      line with it, so the formula builds itself on a quiet board:
   *      "Area = ½ × ( a + b ) × h", a piece at a time
   *   4. a, b and then h are asked for one at a time from a drop-down. The
   *      box in the formula lights while its question is live; a wrong pick
   *      shakes and is answered with a nudge under the box; a right one puts
   *      the number into the formula in place of the letter and lights the
   *      measurement it came from
   *   5. the area last, asked the same way on an "Area = [ v ]" line under
   *      the formula. It is the only answer the confetti is spent on
   *   6. and then the working, on this same board -- the step-by-step scene
   *      that used to follow, merged in: the box dissolves into the sum it
   *      stood for and the line simplifies itself, "Area = ½ × ( 8 + 14 ) × 6"
   *      to "Area = 66 sq. cm", each step flaring the measurement on the
   *      drawing that it is about and the shape swelling once at the answer */

  /* ---------- 3 and 4: the values read off a trapezium, and its area ----------
   * (pages 29 and 30)
   *
   * One unbroken piece across the Next that divides them: the same
   * trapezium, the same halved board, and every value the learner names
   * carried straight into the next thing it is wanted for. Nothing is asked
   * before the learner has watched where its answer is written on the shape,
   * and nothing is answered without the board showing where it came from.
   *
   *   page 29
   *     1. the board opens empty and the trapezium draws itself on it,
   *        slowly, with no instruction anywhere: there is nothing to read
   *        but the shape, and Swiftee waits behind the board
   *     2. the perpendicular height drops in dotted and squares off at its
   *        foot; then one chevron lands on the top parallel side and the
   *        same one on the bottom -- the pair is named before it is measured
   *     3. the three measurements arrive in turn -- 13 cm above, 20 cm
   *        below, 10 cm beside the height -- each popping in on its own
   *        arrow, and its line glowing for a moment as the number lands
   *     4. only now does Swiftee come up from behind the board: "Look at the
   *        trapezium and choose the correct values." The board halves, the
   *        shape glides into the left of it and the panel takes the right,
   *        and two seconds later the bird ducks back down and takes the line
   *        with it, so the questions are asked on a quiet board
   *     5. "Sum of parallel sides is [ v ]". A right pick lights both
   *        parallel sides and writes where the value came from under the
   *        question: it becomes "Sum of parallel sides is 13 + 20 = 33 cm"
   *     6. "Height is [ v ]", with the dotted height lit from the moment the
   *        question appears; its answer joins the first under it
   *
   *   page 30, on the board page 29 left, both values still written on it
   *     7. Swiftee comes back with the question -- "What is the area of the
   *        trapezium?" -- and the formula it is answered with builds itself
   *        in words: "Area = 1/2 x (sum of parallel sides) x height"
   *     8. the two boxes then give way to the numbers the learner found,
   *        each lighting the part of the figure it was read off, so the
   *        formula reads "Area = 1/2 x 33 x 10" before the options exist
   *     9. and only then the answer, which solves itself into 165 sq. cm
   *
   * A wrong pick shakes its box and is answered under it, and the nudge goes
   * a step further every time: first the part of the figure to look at, then
   * the operation, then the whole setup written out. */

   *      "What is the area of the trapezium?" -- where the line STAYS. It is

   *      the one question in the section that measures rather than teaches
   *   6. a pick lights the two parallel sides and then the height on the
   *      figure -- the feedback is read off the measurements first -- and
   *      only then does the working solve itself in the panel: 30 and 40
   *      make 70, and half of 70 fifteens is 525 sq. cm, which glows once
   *   7. a wrong pick shakes its chip and is answered under the tray, a step
